/**
 * Per-harness descriptor registry — the single source of truth for which agent
 * harnesses `keeper agent` drives and how each one behaves. Every parallel
 * harness union (`AgentKind`, `AgentCli`, `PresetHarness`) and its runtime name
 * set (`AGENT_CLIS`, `PRESET_HARNESSES`, the run-capture agent set) is DERIVED
 * from {@link HARNESS_DESCRIPTORS} here, so a harness name lives in exactly one
 * place. Downstream gates read a capability flag, NEVER a harness-name allowlist:
 * panel eligibility is `capturable`, not a `claude|codex` literal.
 *
 * DEP-FREE ISLAND: this module imports NOTHING. It sits at the bottom of the
 * launch-config / config / dispatch / run-capture cluster (they import it; it
 * imports none of them), so it can never form an import cycle nor drag a heavier
 * dependency onto the cold-start `keeper agent` path. Pure data only — a harness
 * is a row of facts here, not a branch scattered across forty edit sites.
