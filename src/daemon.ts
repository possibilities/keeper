/**
 * Keeper daemon — the long-running reducer process. Managed in production by a
 * LaunchAgent that re-runs `bun run src/daemon.ts` on any non-clean exit.
 *
 * Boot sequence (the locked design):
 *
 *   1. Open the writer connection (`openDb`). DDL + forward-only migration run
 *      inside `openDb`; the reducer_state cursor is seeded there too.
 *   2. Boot drain: `while (drain(db, BATCH) > 0) {}` — fold every unfolded event
 *      using the SAME code path as steady-state. After downtime this catches the
 *      projection up before the daemon goes live.
 *   3. Spawn TWO worker threads (both AFTER migrate + boot drain, so their
 *      read-only `openDb` connections never race a missing/un-migrated DB):
 *      - the wake worker — opens its own read-only connection, polls
 *        `PRAGMA data_version`, and posts a contentless `{ kind: "wake" }`
 *        whenever another connection commits.
 *      - the server worker — owns the UDS read surface: its own read-only
 *        connection, the `keeperd.lock` ownership lock, an NDJSON listener, and
 *        its own `data_version` poll that fans `jobs` changes out as patches.
 *   4. Steady state: every wake triggers a full drain loop. Wakes that arrive
 *      mid-drain coalesce into the next pass via a single "wake pending" flag —
 *      no event is missed (drain always re-reads from the cursor) and drain is
 *      never invoked re-entrantly.
 *   5. SIGTERM: post `{ type: "shutdown" }` to BOTH workers, await both `close`
 *      events against a short deadline, terminate both, close the db, exit 0.
 *      This is the ONLY clean exit. The server worker releases its socket + lock
 *      inside its own shutdown handler (the socket is process-owned, so
 *      `terminate()` alone would leak it).
 *
 * Crash policy (single recovery path): ANY unrecoverable error — either worker's
 * `error` event, an unhandled rejection, or a fold throw that escapes the
 * per-event guard — calls `process.exit(1)`. The LaunchAgent
 * `KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit = false` then restarts us. We deliberately keep ONE
 * well-tested recovery path rather than attempting in-process self-heal — no
 * in-process respawn of either worker.
