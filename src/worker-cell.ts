/**
 * Launcher-owned worker-cell resolution — the ONE seam both work-launch
 * producers (the autopilot reconciler and manual `keeper dispatch`) share to
 * decide which per-cell `work` plugin a task's launch loads.
 *
 * PRODUCER-ONLY, filesystem-probing by contract. Every function here may read
 * the on-disk plugin tree (manifest existence, a scan-dir shadow probe), so it
 * lives OUTSIDE the pure reducer: {@link resolveWorkerCell} is called from a
 * producer path (`runReconcileCycle` / the dispatch CLI), NEVER a `reconcile`
 * arm or any fold — re-fold determinism holds because no fold reaches this
 * module. The pure `workerCellPluginDir` compose STAYS in `reconcile-core`
 * (the pure reducer import must never gain an I/O-module dep); this module
 * imports it one-directionally, never the reverse.
 *
 * The seam returns MACHINE KINDS ONLY — a closed discriminated union of
 * `{ok:true, pluginDir}` and four typed rejects, carrying minimal machine
 * fields and NO prose. Each caller composes its own operator text from the
 * kind, which is exactly what keeps the producer's byte-pinned sticky-reason
 * strings (including the `KEEPER_ROOT`-baked remediation) untouched while a
 * hand-run dispatch prints its own three-part actionable error. A closed union
 * plus `assertNever` at each caller makes the compiler the parity net: a new
 * reject kind fails compilation at any unmapped switch.
