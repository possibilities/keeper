# plan

`keeper plan` is a file-based CLI for managing epics, tasks, dependencies, and markdown specs in structured software workflows.

- Data lives in `.keeper/` inside the project directory, under version control.
- Task runtime state is separated from task definitions.
- Spec changes are written in place to `specs/{id}.md`. Git provides the audit trail.
- Commands emit JSON by default. Pass `--format human` for human-readable output. `cat` always emits raw markdown.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) `1.3.14` — runs the compiled TypeScript dispatcher under `src/`

## Entrypoint

`keeper plan <verb>` is the canonical command. It runs the plan verb dispatcher in-process through the single `keeper` binary (`cli/plan.ts` imports `plugins/plan/src/cli.ts`); there is no separate standalone CLI on `PATH`.

```bash
keeper plan --help
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Initialize current project
keeper plan init

# 2) Scaffold an epic + its tasks in one transactional call
#    (plan.yaml: epic mapping + ordered tasks list, deps as 1-based ordinals)
keeper plan scaffold --file plan.yaml

# 3) Refine an existing epic later (add tasks, rewrite specs/deps)
keeper plan refine-apply fn-1-add-auth --file delta.yaml

# 4) Work the task lifecycle (claim asserts + claims + writes the worker brief, returns a brief_ref)
keeper plan claim fn-1-add-auth.1
keeper plan done fn-1-add-auth.1 --summary "Chose JWT strategy"

# 5) Inspect state
keeper plan list
keeper plan validate
```

## Command Map

Top-level commands:

- `init`, `detect`, `status`, `validate`, `state-path`
- `claim`, `resolve-task`, `reconcile`, `find-task-commit`, `done`, `block`, `unblock`, `epic-question`, `ready`
- `close-preflight`, `audit submit`, `audit gate-check`, `audit submit-task`, `verdict submit`, `followup submit`, `close-finalize`
- `show`, `epics`, `tasks`, `list`, `cat`
- `mv-repo`, `selection-brief`, `selection-audit-brief`, `selection-review-submit`, `assign-cells`, `apply-selection`
- `epic`, `task`, `dep`

The board verb `unblock` (flips a task `blocked → todo`, preserving claim history) is distinct from the `/plan:unblock` escalation SKILL: autopilot dispatches the skill as an `unblock::<task>` session to resolve a blocked task autonomously, and that session may CALL the `unblock` board verb as one of its actions. Both escalation skills (`/plan:unblock`, `/plan:deconflict`) load their incident context from the keeper-core `keeper escalation-brief <verb>::<id>` command — NOT a `keeper plan` verb — which resolves the incident details, the transcript pointers, and the creator lineage, walking a closer creator back to the original creator with session ids and transcript paths for both.

`resolve-task <task_id>` (fn-593) — read-only routing lookup returning the subset of `claim`'s envelope an external consumer needs to route a worker and police cwd. A public CLI surface; the `arthack-claude.py` launcher does not call it (keeper reads `task.tier` from its own projected Task data for board/projection and launches workers with a per-cell `--plugin-dir` it resolves producer-side from the task's `{model, effort}` cell — the loaded `work` plugin is what routes the tier). Cwd-agnostic (scans configured `roots`); supports `--project <path>` to disambiguate. Returns `{task_id, epic_id, project_path, target_repo, primary_repo, tier, worker_model, worker_agent, status}` — `tier` is a configured effort or `null`, `worker_model` is a configured model or `null`, and `worker_agent` is the composed `plan:worker-<model>-<effort>` string retained as a null-either-axis gate signal (`null` when either axis is null), not a spawn target — `/plan:work` spawns the constant `work:worker` and the launcher selects the matching cell via `--plugin-dir`. No `.keeper/` write, no commit. Typed errors: `BAD_TASK_ID | TASK_NOT_FOUND | AMBIGUOUS_TASK_ID | NOT_A_PROJECT`.

`reconcile <task_id>` (fn-6) — read-only post-worker verdict verb, the symmetric bookend to `claim`'s pre-worker brief handoff. Collapses the `/plan:work` orchestrator's post-worker reconciliation into one call returning a typed verdict the orchestrator switches on mechanically: `done | in_progress_committed | in_progress_uncommitted | blocked | state_uncommitted | not_started | tooling_error`. Computed entirely from plan-native data — merged status, trailer-authentic source commits (against `target_repo` + `epic.touched_repos`), HEAD-visibility of the committed task JSON (against `state_repo`), and an epic-progress tally — with NO keeper dependency. Any git subprocess failure fails closed to `tooling_error`. Cwd-agnostic (scans configured `roots`); supports `--project <path>` to disambiguate. Returns `{verdict, task_id, epic_id, status, source_commits, state_head_visible, epic_progress, assessed_at, blocked_reason}`. No `.keeper/` write, no commit. Typed errors: `BAD_TASK_ID | TASK_NOT_FOUND | AMBIGUOUS_TASK_ID`.

`find-task-commit <task_id>` — read-only commit lookup for a single task. Wraps the native `Task:`-trailer scan and emits the flat envelope a worker's harness-drop predecessor-detection consumes: `{"success": true, "commits": [{"sha": "<%H>", "repo": "<abs-path>"}, ...]}` (`sha`/`repo` field names, full `%H`; repo-outer first-seen order, per-repo grep order, SHAs deduped per repo). A clean miss is a normal empty success (`commits: []`, exit 0). The verb fails loud (`COMMIT_LOOKUP_FAILED`, exit 1, with `details.broken_repos`) only when every repo in the resolved scan set is missing or not a git repo. Resolution is plan-native: the owning project is found cwd-agnostically via `find_projects_with_task` (`--project <abs>` to disambiguate), then `primary_repo` / `touched_repos` are read off the epic record to seed the scan set. No `.keeper/` write, no commit. Typed errors: `BAD_TASK_ID | TASK_NOT_FOUND | AMBIGUOUS_TASK_ID | NOT_A_PROJECT`.

`mv-repo <old> <new>` — metadata-only board rewrite after a repo directory is renamed. It does NOT move any directory: the operator renames the dir, then this verb rewrites every stored board path in the current project — each epic's `primary_repo`, each `touched_repos` entry, and each task's `target_repo` matching `<old>` → `<new>` — re-validates every touched epic through the post-write integrity gate (the marker is left untouched), and lands the whole rewrite in ONE `chore(plan): mv-repo <new>` commit. Matching is by the `realpath`-canonicalized stored string, never a stat of `<old>` (it is gone by definition of a rename) and never lowercased (APFS is case-insensitive). `<new>` must exist and carry a `.git/` or the verb refuses loudly. Naturally idempotent — a re-run finds nothing matching `<old>` and is a no-op; `old == new` after canonicalization is likewise a no-op. This is the bulk-rename path: prefer it over per-epic `epic set-primary-repo` / per-task `task set-target-repo` when a whole repo moved.

`selection-brief <epic_id>` — content-blind handoff for the post-scaffold selector. It writes `.keeper/state/selections/<epic_id>/brief.json` (gitignored, commit-free) containing the selector policy config, epic spec, todo task specs, configured axes, candidate cells, and config/input hashes, then emits only `{brief_ref, config_hash, input_hash, shuffle_seed, task_ids, candidate_cells}`. `/plan:plan` and `/plan:defer` pass that handle to `plan:model-selector` instead of inlining spec prose. Typed errors: `BAD_EPIC_ID`, `NOT_A_PROJECT`, `AMBIGUOUS_EPIC_ID`, `EPIC_NOT_FOUND`, `CONFIG_MISSING`, `MATRIX_MISSING`, `EPIC_SPEC_MISSING`, `TASK_SPEC_MISSING`, `NO_TODO_TASKS`.

`assign-cells <epic_id> --file -` and `apply-selection <epic_id> --file -` share one apply core — flock the epic, mutate every named task's `{tier, model}` under it, write the schema-versioned sidecar to `.keeper/selections/<epic_id>.json`, re-validate the tree through the post-write integrity gate (the marker is left untouched, so a ghost stays a ghost until the trailing `validate --epic` arm), then auto-commit the cell writes AND the sidecar in ONE commit — no partial writes on any failure. There is no single-task form of either, which is what keeps them outside the removed incremental `task set-tier` class. They are the two entry points onto that shared core: `assign-cells` takes a hand- or tooling-authored YAML batch — a `cells:` list covering EVERY todo task of the epic exactly once (choosing the default is an explicit cell) plus a `selection:` provenance block (selector source, config + input hashes, shuffle seed, outcome, raw verdict) — and asserts the whole batch itself (assert-all, collect-all); `apply-selection` (below) takes the raw stdin JSON a `plan:model-selector` subagent returned and validates it against the on-disk selection brief instead of trusting the caller. Their callers are the `/plan:plan` (Phase 6.5), `/plan:defer` (Phase 4b), and `/plan:close` (Phase 3.5, follow-up) select beats: each pipes the content-blind `plan:model-selector` subagent's raw return straight to `apply-selection`, landing cells with `label_source: heuristic-guided`, and every selector failure degrades to the stamped defaults recorded with `label_source: heuristic-default`. Axis validation comes from the embedded subagents matrix only — neither verb reads `model-selector.yaml`. Typed errors (`assign-cells`): `bad_yaml` (shape/type), `cell_invalid` (out-of-axis tier/model, or an unknown / duplicate / missing / non-todo task id — the full-set + todo-only contract), `epic_not_found`.

`apply-selection <epic_id> --file -` (ADR 0027) is the ONE trusted apply seam for a model-selector verdict: the calling skill pipes the `plan:model-selector` subagent's raw JSON return verbatim on stdin (a single ```` ```json ```` fence is tolerated) — never parses, enum-clamps, or transcribes it — and the verb parses, schema-validates, enum-clamps each `tier`/`model` against the candidate axes, and asserts exact coverage of the on-disk selection brief (`.keeper/state/selections/<epic_id>/brief.json`, written by `selection-brief`) before landing anything; provenance (`config_hash`, `input_hash`, `shuffle_seed`) is pinned from that brief, never transcribed from the model's own claims. On the live path it lands cells through the shared core above with `label_source: heuristic-guided`. `--from-followup` re-targets validation at `followup-brief.json` and, instead of a live write, atomically stages the verdict as a gitignored `followup-verdict.json` sibling of the brief — the document `close-finalize --selection-verdict` consumes when a follow-up epic's tasks are born pre-selected — returning `verdict_path` rather than landing a commit; `/plan:close` (Phase 3.5) is its caller. `--degraded <reason>` (live-only, rejected together with `--from-followup`) skips validation entirely and re-asserts each current todo task's own stamped cell with `label_source: heuristic-default` and no stdin, so a selector failure still leaves the epic armable — every calling skill's two-strike contract (one relayed retry, then degrade) bottoms out here. Typed errors: `verdict_invalid` (bad JSON, bad shape, an error-shaped return, an unknown top-level key, an enum-clamp miss, or a coverage miss against the brief), `brief_missing` (no brief on disk for this epic/mode, or a `from_followup` mismatch), `cell_invalid` (from the shared core — out-of-axis tier/model, or an unknown / duplicate / missing / non-todo task id), `epic_not_found`.

The close phase (`/plan:close`) runs as five verbs the content-blind coordinator switches on. `close-preflight <epic_id>` is the pre-audit brief handoff (the bookend to `claim`): it confirms every task is `done`, scans each repo's `Task:`-trailer source commits — the epic lane branch `keeper/epic/<epic_id>` when that worktree lane is present, else `HEAD` — so a worktree epic's lane-only commits are visible before they merge to the default branch (a single-repo / non-worktree close is unchanged, and a post-merge re-run self-heals once the lane is pruned), writes the close-phase brief to `<primary_repo>/.keeper/state/audits/<epic_id>/brief.json` (commit-free, atomic) — the brief carries per-task `{id, title, status, target_repo, done_summary}` plus the epic's `touched_repos` on the root, the repo map the close-planner reads to route each follow-up task — and returns `{primary_repo, brief_ref, commit_set_hash, tasks, all_done}` — a not-all-done epic is a typed `TASKS_NOT_DONE` error. It also claims the close exclusively: a second concurrent closer for the same epic fails loud with `CLOSE_ALREADY_CLAIMED` while the first proceeds unaffected (`close-finalize` releases the claim on every terminal outcome — success or typed error — so a re-run re-claims cleanly). `audit submit` / `verdict submit` / `followup submit` persist the quality-auditor's report, the close-planner's verdict JSON, and its follow-up plan YAML under `audits/<epic_id>/`, each validating at emission with typed reject envelopes (commit-free, like `claim`). `close-finalize <epic_id>` encodes the saga from observable state — stale-check on `commit_set_hash` (`STALE_ARTIFACTS`), fatal-halt, reversible follow-up scaffold BEFORE the irreversible `epic close` — and returns one of five typed `CloseOutcome` members (`closed_clean | closed_with_followup | fatal_halt | partial_followup | followup_blocks_close`); it is idempotent on re-run. `followup_blocks_close` is the **blocking follow-up gate** (ADR 0028): when the close audit's follow-up corrects a consumer-observable flaw the source establishes and exposes (a verdict carrying `blocks_closing: true`), finalize mints and arms the follow-up with a committed `blocks_closing_of` pointer and the source's still-resolving epic-deps substituted in place of the source itself (a follow-up→source edge would deadlock), then leaves the source epic OPEN — a close-row readiness predicate holds it (and every dependent, through ordinary dep-on-epic readiness with no rewiring) until the follow-up is done and close-idle, and a re-dispatched closer re-enters on the committed pointer to adopt it into `closed_with_followup`. A non-blocking or legacy verdict drives the prior flow unchanged; a follow-up deleted while gating is a typed `BLOCKING_FOLLOWUP_DELETED` failure, never a silent close.

`audit gate-check <task_id>` and `audit submit-task <task_id>` are the per-task audit gate's typed, content-blind seam — the pair `/plan:work`'s Phase 2d polls between a flagged worker's commit and its done-stamp, so the orchestrator never opens the per-task finding artifact or the worker's brief. `gate-check` is read-only: it derives the task's CURRENT commit set itself (`deriveTaskCommitGroups`, the same scan-repo derivation `reconcile` uses) and compares it against the persisted finding's stamped `commit_set_hash`, returning `{exists, covers_current_commits, status, finding_ref}` — an absent, unreadable, or too-new-schema artifact clamps `status`/`covers_current_commits` to the safe not-covering default rather than fabricating a reading. `submit-task` persists the task-scoped `quality-auditor`'s findings payload commit-free into `state/audits/<epic_id>/tasks/<task_id>.json`; `commits` is never taken from the caller — it is the identical server-side derivation `gate-check` reads, so the two verbs' hashes can never drift apart — and `--status` (`clean | mild | severe`) is required and enum-validated. Both are runtime-state-only (no `.keeper/` commit), mirroring `claim` / `audit submit`. Typed errors (both): `BAD_TASK_ID | NOT_A_PROJECT | TASK_NOT_FOUND | AMBIGUOUS_TASK_ID | GIT_UNAVAILABLE`; `submit-task` also: `BAD_STATUS | BAD_JSON | BAD_PAYLOAD`.

Subcommands:

- `epic`: `create`, `set-plan`, `set-branch`, `set-title`, `close`, `rm`, `add-dep`, `rm-dep`
- `task`: `create`, `set-description`, `set-acceptance`, `set-spec`, `reset`, `set-deps`
- `dep`: `add`
- `worker`: `resume`

## Storage Layout

All data lives in `.keeper/` inside the project directory:

```text
{project_root}/.keeper/
  meta.json
  epics/{epic-id}.json
  specs/{epic-id}.md
  specs/{task-id}.md
  tasks/{task-id}.json
  selections/{epic-id}.json # committed model+effort selection sidecars (assign-cells)
  selection-audit-briefs/{epic-id}.json # committed selection-audit brief (selection-audit-brief)
  selection-reviews/{epic-id}.json # committed out-of-band selection-review dataset (selection-review-submit)
  state/                    # gitignored -- ephemeral runtime data
    tasks/{task-id}.state.json    # task runtime status
    epics/{epic-id}.state.json    # epic runtime sidecar
    selections/{epic-id}/brief.json # selector brief handoff (selection-brief)
    locks/{task-id}.lock
```

Specs are written in place to `specs/{id}.md` by commands that mutate spec content (`done`, `task set-description`, `task set-acceptance`, `task set-spec`, `task reset`, `epic set-plan`, `task create`, `epic create`). Git history provides the audit trail.

Environment variables:

- `KEEPER_PLAN_ACTOR` (override identity)
- `KEEPER_PLAN_NOW` (overrides the clock source for all timestamp stamping in `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ` format; any conforming implementation must honor it)
- `KEEPER_PLAN_SESSION_ID` (explicit session identity override for manual or embedded plan invocations)
- `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` / `KEEPER_JOB_ID` (ambient tracked-harness identities; Claude identity takes precedence when both are present). The resolved id keys the touched-paths log under `.keeper/state/sessions/<session_id>/` and is required for every mutating verb except `init`.

## Auto-commit

Mutating verbs emit a `plan_invocation` NDJSON envelope on stdout scoped to that write, and land a `chore(plan): <op> <target>` commit inline at `output.emit()` via `auto_commit_from_invocation` — the commit happens BEFORE the success envelope prints, so the envelope's appearance on stdout is the authoritative signal that the `.keeper/` commit landed. Read-only / inspection verbs emit exactly one top-level JSON value and no `plan_invocation` trailer (nothing consumes it on a read, and a second root breaks `json.load` / `jq`). Runtime-only verbs like `claim`/`block` mutate but land no commit (`files` is empty → no-op). `claim` writes the worker brief to `<primary_repo>/.keeper/state/briefs/<task_id>.json` and returns a `brief_ref` handle, but that brief lives under gitignored `state/`, so it too lands no commit. On commit failure the runner prints a structured `{"success": false, "error": "commit_failed", "details": {...}}` envelope on stdout and exits 1 — the success envelope is NOT printed.

`init` is the session-id-free mutating verb: it builds its own commit payload directly (an explicit list of the bootstrap files it created), so it needs neither the touched-paths log nor a tracked harness identity. It lands a `chore(plan): init <project-name>` commit with no `Session-Id:` trailer, but only when it wrote something AND the cwd is inside a git work tree — an idempotent re-run or an `init` in a non-git dir takes the read-only path with no commit.

For source-code commits from workers and free-form operators, use `keeper commit-work`:

```bash
# Preview what will be staged
keeper commit-work --preview-files

# Commit with a message (auto-pushes to origin on success)
keeper commit-work --task-id fn-N-slug.M "feat(scope): add the feature"
```

A free-form operator first runs `keeper plan claim fn-N-slug.M` in the same
tracked operator session, then previews with
`keeper commit-work --task-id fn-N-slug.M --preview-files` and lands with
`keeper commit-work --task-id fn-N-slug.M "<message>"`. The literal `--task-id`
must be the first option. The live exact-task marker admits that main-context
call and authorizes Keeper to append the mechanical `Task:` trailer even though
the operator job is not a bound `work` job. Do not supply a `Task:` line,
delegate the landing to a generic subagent, or set
`KEEPER_PLAN_GUARD_BYPASS`; each remains outside the operator commit rail.

Every invocation emits one versioned `commit-work-result` JSON line. Preview
explains the complete dirty surface and ownership categories; success carries
both the exact local `commit` identity and `push` state. A first push updates the
captured remote branch from the immutable commit SHA, then configures tracking
separately. Push failures carry `push_error_class`; no result ever asks an agent
to recreate an already-published local commit. There is no `--no-push` flag, and
`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` keeps non-TTY failures bounded.

A missing file is covered only by exact invocation-local `--adopt <path>`
arguments or a versioned `--adopt-from` manifest after inspection. Adoption is
bound to the frozen blob OID/mode, creates no durable claim, and refuses a live
or unknown foreign exclusive claimant. Bash/codegen/package-manager evidence is
an observation, never automatic ownership. Do not fall back to raw Git around
ownership, lint, hooks, signing, or compare-and-swap publication. Wrapped cells
use fresh descriptor-created temp handoffs, launch-bound non-Claude provider
legs, helper-disabled Git reads, and the literal launch task for both
`commit-work` and non-forced `plan done`; the wrapper itself never runs repository
code.

## Version Control Advice

**Do not gitignore `.keeper/`.** Plan data is meant to be committed -- the `state/` subdirectory already has its own `.gitignore` for ephemeral runtime files (locks, active task state).

If you use a context-dump tool, add `.keeper/` to its ignore file so plan data doesn't flood your context.

## Output Contract

Commands emit JSON by default:

- Success: `{"success": true, ...}`
- Failure: `{"success": false, "error": "..."}` for a single-code commit failure; the accumulate-all failure path (scaffold / refine-apply) emits the converged error OBJECT `{"success": false, "error": {"code", "message", "details": [...], "recovery"}}` — `recovery` is an actionable next step keyed on `code` (see `docs/problem-codes.md`).
- Non-JSON failures print `Error: ...` to stderr and exit non-zero.

The plan `emit()` family is deliberately exempt from keeper's shared one-shot envelope (`{schema_version, ok, error, data}` in `cli/envelope.ts`): its `{success, ...data, plan_invocation}` shape is frozen for Python byte-parity and the one-JSON-root guard, and converges with the shared surface only on the error sub-object's `{code, message, recovery}` fields.

**Every read-only / inspection verb emits exactly one top-level JSON value** — one root, zero trailing bytes, so `json.load` and `jq` parse it cleanly (a second root raises "Extra data"). A conformance guard asserts this by parsing roots, not counting lines (a single pretty-printed value spans many lines). Provenance never rides the result stream: read verbs carry no `plan_invocation` trailer.

`keeper plan list` and `keeper plan tasks` bound their output with a `{total, returned, truncated, hint}` envelope wrapping the rows — `truncated: true` and a `hint` string signal a capped set. The `--format human` render is byte-unchanged.

Pass `--format human` for human-readable text/tables.
`cat` always emits raw markdown regardless of `--format`.
`validate` uses a custom envelope: `{"valid": bool, "errors": [...], "warnings": [...]}` (exits 1 on `valid: false`). With `--epic <id>`, `validate` doubles as the marker **arm** and is its SOLE null→timestamp writer: the create, defer, and close flows run it after wiring deps to flip a freshly-scaffolded epic's null `last_validated_at` to a timestamp (a fresh scaffold mints a not-ready ghost). The marker is an arm-exclusive one-way latch — no structural mutation verb ever writes it, and the only un-arm (timestamp→null) paths are `epic invalidate` and `refine-context --invalidate`. When the marker is still null, the runner manually invokes `auto_commit_from_invocation` (bypassing `emit()` to preserve the custom envelope shape) and merges the `plan_invocation` provenance into the single custom envelope — one JSON value on stdout, never a second document. Arming an already-armed epic is a no-op — only the one envelope prints (no commit).

## Worker matrix

`~/.config/keeper/matrix.yaml` is required. It defines the worker-cell eligibility list, effort bands, cell-template inventory, ordered provider roster, and fixed wrapper driver (ADR 0036). Each task carries a `{model, tier}` cell; the task's cell plus any producer-side worker-provider constraint selects one matrix cell at dispatch. There are no task-specific worker prompt artifacts.

The Claude compiler owns the complete shared cohort under `workers/<model>-<effort>/`:

```bash
keeper prompt compile --role work:worker --target claude
# equivalent scope: keeper prompt compile --bundle plan:work --target claude
```

It compiles every matrix-derived cell, snapshots the literal include graph, and fingerprints the catalog, matrix, and sources. It owns the nested plugin files, JSON sidecars, manifest, and owned-orphan cleanup; publication is verified and manifest-last. `--check` is write-free. `keeper prompt render-plugin-templates --project-root plugins/plan` remains a compatibility front door that delegates worker publication once; install and promote retain it, and promotion verifies compiler state.

`/plan:work` always spawns the constant `work:worker`; the launcher adds the exact selected physical cell via `--plugin-dir`. Manual and autopilot dispatch use the same read-only verifier for current fingerprint, inventory, hashes, and selected membership. An absent selected manifest fails as `worker-cell-missing`; a present manifest with invalid fingerprint, inventory, hashes, or selected membership fails as `worker-cell-stale`. Either is remediated with `keeper prompt compile --role work:worker --target claude`. A configured or cwd `work` plugin is a shadow, not a substitute. `worker_plugin_isolation` is config-gated: absent or `off` retains `plugin_scan_dirs` results; `strip-scan-dirs` removes only those results while hard `plugin_dirs` and cwd detection remain. Runtime shadow inventory mirrors that setting.

Native cells launch their exact Claude route with `maxTurns: 300`. Wrapped cells retain their assigned and effective capability but run the fixed wrapper driver with `maxTurns: 160`, delegating implementation to the runtime-resolved provider leg while the wrapper owns keeper close-out. The compiler does not perform provider-equivalence adaptation.

Run `keeper agent presets list --json` to enumerate the full virtual launch cube (every `<harness>::<model>::<effort>` triple the roster serves, the four `<harness>_default` triples, and each configured panel with its ordered members, authored strength, and description). `keeper agent providers check` lints the operator's configured host triples (defaults, worker, escalation, panel `members`) against that cube, flagging a well-formed triple outside it as drift. Inspect one route with `keeper agent providers resolve <model> <effort>` (emits the driver plus the cost-ordered candidate harnesses, each carrying an auto-generated `<provider>-<model>` label).

The post-scaffold **model selector** (`plan:model-selector`, fed by `keeper plan selection-brief`) assigns each todo task's `{tier, model}` cell — wrapped capability models included — from the configured axes, batch-written by `assign-cells`. `/plan:model-guidance` authors the per-axis-value guidance the selector reads; every roster model needs a guidance block, enforced fail-loud by the drift gate.

On the model axis the selector's binding tie-break is a human-owned, hand-tuned policy — `model-selector.yaml`'s `hand_tuned` block, carried verbatim in every selector brief and never touched by `/plan:model-guidance`'s research pass (which only refreshes the guidance around it). The burden of proof is on opus: sonnet is the default implementation workhorse, and opus is chosen only on a concrete, nameable intelligence-bound reason (a novel algorithm or design, a cross-cutting multi-file architectural cascade, a subtle correctness or security invariant, long-horizon planning) or a hard security/correctness gate. On a tie, or absent such a reason, the model axis resolves down to sonnet; mechanical or templated work likewise biases the effort axis toward the lower bands. Edit `hand_tuned` directly to retune the policy — it is cheap-to-change config (ADR 0010), not code.

## Selection-audit brief

`/plan:close` captures selection-audit data as a mechanical, commit-only beat before the irreversible `epic close`, and it can never delay or block the close (every failure mode degrades silently to a logged skip). `keeper plan selection-audit-brief <epic_id>` assembles, for each genuinely selected-and-executed task cell, the spec, per-task diff stats, and the done summary into a committed brief at `.keeper/selection-audit-briefs/<epic_id>.json` — write-once per epic, `--force` to re-derive, idempotent on a re-close. The brief carries no selector rationale, confidence, or label source, so a later grading pass stays blind to the selector's own reasoning.

Each auditable task's cell coverage names two cells, the **assigned→dispatched distinction**: `assigned_tier`/`assigned_model` is the selector's untouched pick from the selection sidecar, while `tier`/`model` is the cell that actually DISPATCHED — equal to the assigned cell unless a worker-provider constraint translated it at claim, in which case a `constraint` string (else `null`) names the pin that did the translating. Grading always targets the dispatched cell, since that is the cell whose outcome the brief's diff stats and done summary describe.

Grading that brief is a human-invoked, out-of-band skill, never something `/plan:close` triggers. `keeper plan selection-review-submit <epic_id> --file <verdict.json>` validates a verdict document (exact coverage of the auditable task set, rubric/judge/prompt version keys, a non-empty evidence sentence per verdict) and, on success, writes the committed per-epic dataset at `.keeper/selection-reviews/<epic_id>.json` — write-once per epic, `--force` to re-write. Each verdict snapshots the graded `{tier, model}` cell (the dispatched cell) plus the selection run's config/input hashes, so the row joins to the selection sidecar across a future re-select.

## Planning Skills

These slash commands handle epic creation, refinement, single-task execution, the post-epic-close phase, and tier-1/2/3 followup audit:

| Command | When to use |
|---------|------------|
| `/plan <request>` | Any new feature — spawns scouts, runs gap-analyst, full outer-loop quality pass. Stamps the mechanical default `{tier, model}` cell at scaffold, then runs the post-scaffold selector beat to overwrite the cells before arming. Use for anything non-trivial. |
| `/plan:work <fn-N-slug.M>` | Drive a single claimed task to `done` by spawning the constant `work:worker` subagent — the launcher selects the tier-matched per-cell `work` plugin at launch via `--plugin-dir`, so `work:worker` resolves to it — and switching on `keeper plan reconcile`'s typed verdict. A content-blind orchestrator under hook-enforced no-commit constraints: it never edits, lints, or commits — every non-`done` verdict routes back into the worker as a resume directive, and the plugin's PreToolUse commit hard-deny permits only the selected worker or the separate exact-claim operator ritual. |
| `/plan:defer <subject>` | The sole single-task scaffolder. Mainlines the actionable work in the conversation into a single-task epic at normal epic-number order — no priority jump — and stops on overrun rather than silently scaling up. Runs the same default-stamp plus selector beat over its single task before arming. Member of the `/plan:plan` family (not a job-launcher). Hand-written tracked skill. |
| `/plan:hack <request>` | Investigate a request, answer in the right shape, then route or execute the next move. Read-only by default — investigate, answer, stop; with plain-text greenlight it executes tight inline work, sketches a direction in chat, or funnels larger work to `/plan:plan` or `/plan:defer`. Slash-only (`disable-model-invocation: true`). Hand-authored static skill — no template, no `.managed-file-dont-edit` sidecar. |
| `/plan:panel <hard question>` | Fan a hard question out to a configured described panel of models answering in parallel and blind, then fuse their answers via the `plan:panel-judge` subagent with consensus, contradictions, and blind spots surfaced. Choose from the live roster's authored strength bands and descriptions (`keeper agent presets list --json`); never infer fit from a panel name or member count. Model-invokable for non-tiny judgment-decided inquiries where being confidently wrong is expensive (mechanical retrieval stays solo); `/plan:hack` routes to it before sketching above-inline work. Hand-authored static skill — no template, no `.managed-file-dont-edit` sidecar. |
| `/plan:prompt <prompt>` | Polish a raw prompt into a sharper one for the agent that will read it — a batched maturity loop toward a named rung (headline/blurb/note/memo/brief/spec), each turn recomputing a filled/total slot meter and making one clustered move (an approvable change-set, an `AskUserQuestion` batch, or an explore), with a constraint-polarity check on every rewrite; at first ready a Ship it / Keep polishing / Grow a rung fork. Read-only wrt the repo, clipboard-only export, nothing written to disk. Slash-only (`disable-model-invocation: true`). Hand-authored static skill — no template, no `.managed-file-dont-edit` sidecar. |
| `/plan:close <epic_id>` | After all tasks in an epic are done: a content-blind coordinator that runs `keeper plan close-preflight` → spawns `quality-auditor` blind (it persists its report via `audit submit`) → on findings, spawns `close-planner` blind (it vets/culls/merges and persists the verdict + follow-up plan via `verdict submit` / `followup submit`) → when survivors will scaffold a follow-up, interposes a content-blind pre-select beat (`keeper plan selection-brief --from-followup` → `plan:model-selector` blind → pipes its raw return to `keeper plan apply-selection --from-followup`, which validates it against the brief and stages the verdict document, handing finalize its path via `--selection-verdict` so the follow-up tasks are born with researched cells, degrading to a verdict-less finalize on any hitch) → `keeper plan close-finalize` and a total switch over its five typed `CloseOutcome` members. On a `followup_blocks_close` outcome the closer arms the follow-up on the autopilot surface when the board is in armed mode (`keeper autopilot arm`, so the gate cannot wedge on a board that dispatches only armed epics) and reports the deferred close, leaving the source open; on a re-entry the preflight's `blocking_followup` field short-circuits the audit/plan phases straight to finalize, and a `BLOCKING_FOLLOWUP_DELETED` failure escalates via the source's `epic-question`. Every audit pipeline artifact lives on disk under `<primary_repo>/.keeper/state/audits/<epic_id>/`; the closer holds refs, hashes, counts, and one-line agent returns only — the trusted `apply-selection` verb authors the cell-selection verdict document, never the closer itself. The audit runs INLINE inside close before the irreversible close mutation — no `--audit-required` flag, no `auditor_done_at` stamp, no separate `/plan:audit` session. The planner's `fatal` flag is the only ship-block signal; `close-finalize` halts without closing on a fatal verdict (no status stamp — the absence of a close is the signal). `close-finalize` encodes the saga from observable state (stale-check, fatal-halt, reversible follow-up scaffold before the irreversible `epic close`) and is idempotent on re-run; the scaffold step stamps `epic.created_by_close_of: <source_eid>` onto the minted follow-up, and `close-finalize` discovers the follow-up by exact equality on that stamp — never by `depends_on_epics` membership. The follow-up still wires `depends_on_epics: [<source_eid>]` as a real dependency, but the dep edge is no longer the provenance signal, so a human-planned epic that legitimately depends on the source is never mistaken for the audit follow-up. Halts on a `QUESTION:` from the planner, stamping the question + its unstick sentence onto the epic via `keeper plan epic-question` (board-visible as a needs-human `keeper status` signal) and clearing it on the human's warm/cold resume; under autopilot a `QUESTION:` behaves like `BLOCKED` — the chain stops and the epic stays open. |
| `/plan:model-guidance [axis-value·missing·all]` | Author and refresh the post-scaffold selector's policy config (`model-selector.yaml`) AND the cross-provider equivalence map (`provider-equivalence.yaml`) — research each configured worker model, cache the raw signal under the skill's `references/`, distill it into the config's per-effort and per-model guidance blocks, author/refresh that model's equivalence entries in both directions (flagging contested cells for a human), and re-hash. Reads `model-guidance-check.ts --state` first and derives scope from the fail-closed per-value states (guidance gaps plus equivalence gaps/dangling targets) in at most two questions: blank is the interactive fill-gaps / refresh-specific / wipe flow (wipe never the default, no model name ever typed), an axis value scopes to that one (loud failure on a non-axis name), `missing` fills every gap non-interactively, `all` wipes behind one confirm. Sole writer of `status: researched` — stamped only after a real research pass, else `stub`; a re-pointed launch id stales its equivalence entries exactly as it stales the notes. Owns the content both halves of the drift gate check; the select beats only read the config, and dispatch-time translation only reads the map. Slash-only (`disable-model-invocation: true`). Hand-authored static skill. |
| `/plan:panel-guidance` | Compose or refresh the committed described panel roster (`panel-selector.yaml`) from the live launch cube and model guidance, validate its ten object-shaped panels with the structural gate, then deliberately install the byte-identical copy as `~/.config/keeper/panel.yaml`. Owns the roster's authored strength bands, ordered members, and rich descriptions; panel choosers only read the installed roster. Slash-only (`disable-model-invocation: true`). Hand-authored static skill. |

## Orchestrator hooks

The plugin ships four bun hook dispatchers under `hooks/` that keep the `/plan:work` and `/plan:close` orchestrators content-blind — coordinating with the worker/auditor subagents through typed refs, hashes, counts, and enums only, never a spec or a findings artifact opened from the main context:

- **PreToolUse commit hard-deny** — while the session's claimed task is in progress, permits commits only from the selected `work:worker` or from the marker-owning main-context operator calling `keeper commit-work --task-id <exact-claimed-task>` directly. Raw Git, generic subagents, missing/mismatched Task ids, and `KEEPER_PLAN_GUARD_BYPASS` remain denied.
- **SubagentStop worker guard** — a worker stopping in a non-`done`, non-`BLOCKED:` state gets exactly one corrective round.
- **Stop checklist guard** — a work-session Stop with a still-in-progress claimed task, or a close-session Stop where `close-finalize` never ran, blocks once with a resume checklist. The close branch blocks only when neither of its two zero-subprocess allow gates fires — a sanctioned typed-stop message, or an in-flight subagent the closer spawned and is awaiting (a `background_tasks` entry with `type:"subagent"` + `status:"running"`). The sanctioned typed stops are the `BLOCKED:` / `QUESTION:` escalations, a surfaced `{"success": false}` envelope, and the terminal outcome reports — the fatal-halt, partial-follow-up, and blocking-follow-up deferred-close (`… held open by blocking follow-up …`) surfaces — each kept in lockstep with the close SKILL phrasing.
- **PreToolUse state-read guard** — denies Read/Write/Edit/Bash access to the `.keeper/state/briefs` and `.keeper/state/audits` trees from a work/close session's main context (a subagent — worker, auditor, close-planner — always passes, mirroring the commit guard's discriminant); a Bash command naming those trees is a best-effort companion check. Advisory context hygiene, not a security boundary — it mechanically holds the line once no legitimate orchestrator read of that state remains.

The work guard verifies live task state with a read-only `keeper plan reconcile` call before blocking; the close branch decides from the Stop payload alone (its typed-stop message and `background_tasks`), spawning no subprocess. All four fail open on internal errors. Session state is one JSON marker per session at `~/.local/state/keeper/sessions/<session_id>.json`. `KEEPER_PLAN_GUARD_BYPASS=1` disables the context-read and stop guards, not the commit rail.

## Help for Agents

`keeper plan` includes hidden rich agent guidance:

```bash
keeper plan --agent-help
```

To orient on the board, reach for the keeper-native surfaces rather than hand-parsing plan verbs: `keeper status` for the board at a glance, and `keeper query tasks` for per-task detail (tier/model/title/deps + the live readiness verdict). Every `keeper plan` read still emits one clean JSON value, but the orient surfaces are purpose-built for it.
