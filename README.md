# keeper

Event-sourced control-data daemon for Claude Code agents — Bun + `bun:sqlite`, single host,
single DB. Every agent session feeds an append-only event log; a long-running daemon
(`keeperd`) folds it into live projections and serves them over a subscribe/RPC socket.

- **Session tracking** — every prompt, tool call, and file mutation across Claude and
  Pi sessions lands in one queryable log; managed sessions expose `/rename` through
  each harness's native title surface, with bare bounded inference, canonical explicit
  slugs, and title-preserving failure
- **Live board** — plan epics/tasks, jobs, and git state served as live-updating
  collections (`keeper status`, `keeper board`, `keeper query`)
- **Autopilot** — a reconciler dispatches plan work to managed workers, with worktree
  lanes, merge handling, and escalation; Harness activity, Dispatch claims, and exact
  Resource holds remain independently observable and recoverable
- **Fable focus** — a durable, PII-free Account route preference for Fable work,
  inspectable through account checks, `keeper status`, and `keeper board`; see the
  [routing operations guide](./docs/install.md#claude-account-routing-and-fable-focus)
- **History forensics** — `keeper history list|show|search|files|index` is the
  canonical Claude/Pi surface; `keeper resume <session-reference>` is the human
  foreground continuation path; `keeper transcript` stays for explicit
  subagent/tool-detail or Pi branch-aware drill-down
- **Offline conversion** — `keeper conversation convert` writes resumable native
  sessions in either Claude→Pi or Pi→Claude direction, preserving branches and
  lossless provenance without a daemon or harness runtime
- **Crash restore** — `keeper tabs restore` re-opens managed agent windows; a rolling
  cadence of verified DB snapshots guards the log
- **Agent Bus** — `keeper bus chat send <target> "message"` stores content in a
  confined artifact and reports socket acceptance; a delivered send may also show the
  recipient's pre-fanout Harness activity, never a read receipt. See the
  [bus skill](./plugins/keeper/skills/bus/SKILL.md).
- **Owned panels** — each request admits one bounded fan-out and one generic Task-owned judge;
  retries join the durable request, cancellation settles exact registered children, and daemon
  maintenance resumes pending or failed cleanup without reconstructing targets. See
  [installation and smoke checks](./docs/install.md#pi-task-and-panel-operations) and
  [machine-visible failures](./docs/problem-codes.md#panel-run-lifecycle).
